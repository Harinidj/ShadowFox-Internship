As a part of the ShadowFox ðŸ¦Š Python Development Internship I got to wrok on three different levels:-
1. Beginner level: I got to brush up the basics of python programming such as variables, basic errors and exception handling, loop statements, conditionals and many more!
2. Intermediate level: This level involved a part where a python library "BEAUTIFUL SOUP"  was used for "WEBSCRAPING" it was a little challenging yet fun to work with and the second part involved building a very fun yet educational game "HANGMAN GAME".
3. Advanced level: Suicide Rates Analysis
This is a data analysis project where I explored global suicide rates across different countries, years, genders, and age groups. The goal was to spot patterns, understand possible reasons, and think about ways to prevent it.

Whatâ€™s inside?
1.Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
2.Finding trends in suicide rates over time.
3.Breaking down data by gender and age.
4.Checking how GDP per capita might affect suicide rates
5.Visualizing everything with clear and simple graphs

Dataset
Source: World Health Organization (via Kaggle)
File: master.csv
Columns include: country, year, sex, age, suicides, population, GDP per capita, etc.

Tools I used
1.Python 
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Steps I followed
1.Loaded and cleaned the data
2.Explored trends across years & countries
3.Looked at gender and age group differences
4.Compared suicide rates with GDP per capita
5.Plotted everything for better understanding

Wrote down insights + prevention ideas

What I found
1.Men are more affected compared to women (globally).
2.Suicide rates rise noticeably in certain age groups.
3.GDP and economy can play a role, but not the only reason.
4.Some countries show very high rates while others stay consistently low.

Prevention thoughts
1.Better mental health awareness and services
2.Stronger community support systems

Economic and social help for vulnerable groups

Early intervention programs in schools & workplaces
